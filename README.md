## IDEAS TO ENRICH THE PORTFOLIO
- The journey before or after About me ?
- Add a real about me kind of resume... not a fan of this but might be needed ?
- The tech I use
- Add a section to display my sectors of expertise and interest, this will be a plus for potential clients of those sectors
    - Mechanical Engineering
    - CAD
    - Aerospace/Aviation
    - Flight sim
    - Martial arts and combat sports
    - Hiking 
    - Sport
    - Iceland
    - Japan
- Projects showcase
- Add a Motto section ? or some "arguments" to better understand my personality and thinking ? I can do this for you etc
- Then finish by the usual "contact me"
